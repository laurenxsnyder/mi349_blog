    <p> Hello! My name is Lauren Snyder. I am currently a student at Michigan State University with a major in Information Science. I also have two minors in Photography and Graphic Design. I currently work for the State News as the Social Media Manager and at VIM Magazine as the Photography Director. I also currently have an internship with Kroger's communicaions team.<br>
    A big hobby of mine is traveling. I have been to Portugal, Italy, Greece, and all over the US. I plan on continuing to travel throughout my life.<br>
Another hobby of mine is photography of all kinds. I started doing travel/hobby photography. I then moved onto photojournalism and some fashion photography. I am now exploring creating a photography business, taking graduation and couple's photos. I am looking forward in the future to try my hand at wedding photography.</p>

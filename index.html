    <p>In this blog, I will be discussing some of the different places I have traveled to. First, I will talk about my most recent trip to Greece. I travel with my family and in 2021, we decided to visit Greece. We went to Athens, Santorini, and Mykonos. These three locations are some of the most traveled to spots in Greece, and for good reason. These locations were absolutely spectacular. Athens was extremley interesting because of the incredible history. Mykonons and especially Santorini stood out by their incredible views and unique experiences..</p>

    <p>In this blog, I will be discussing my family's trip to Italy in the summer of 2019. We visited the cities of Rome, Florence, Lake Como, and Venice. These are some very popular tourist spots as well, but they are must-see locations. I had an incredible time learning and seeing all the history in Rome, Venice, and Florence. Lake Como offered incredible views and such an interesting experience. The food was also an amazing experience in all of these locations and I would kill to be able to go back and eat another Italian pasta dish. I also enjoyed the abundance of cats wandering all the cities. Italy was an absolutely amazing experience and I would love to go back any time.</p>
